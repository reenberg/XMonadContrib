-- $usage
-- To wire this up, first add:
--
-- > import XMonad.Hooks.UrgencyHook
--
-- to your import list in your config file. Now, choose an urgency hook. If
-- you're just interested in displaying the urgency state in your custom
-- logHook, then choose NoUrgencyHook. Otherwise, you may use the provided
-- 'dzenUrgencyHook', or write your own.
--
-- Enable your urgency hook by wrapping your config record in a call to
-- 'withUrgencyHook'. For example:
--
-- > main = xmonad $ withUrgencyHook dzenUrgencyHook { args = ["-bg", "darkgreen", "-xs", "1"] }
-- >               $ defaultConfig
--
-- If you want to modify your logHook to print out information about urgent windows,
-- the functions 'readUrgents' and 'withUrgents' are there to help you with that.
-- No example for you.

-- | This is the preferred method of enabling an urgency hook. It will prepend
-- an action to your logHook that removes visible windows from the list of urgent
-- windows. If you don't like that behavior, you may use 'urgencyLayoutHook' instead.

-- The Non-ICCCM Manifesto:
-- Note: Some non-standard choices have been made in this implementation to
-- account for the fact that things are different in a tiling window manager:
--   1. Several clients (e.g. Xchat2, rxvt-unicode) set the urgency flag
--      9 or 10 times in a row. This would, in turn, trigger urgencyHook repeatedly.
--      so in order to prevent that, we immediately clear the urgency flag.
--   2. In normal window managers, windows may overlap, so clients wait for focus to
--      be set before urgency is cleared. In a tiling WM, it's sufficient to be able
--      see the window, since we know that means you can see it completely.
--   3. The urgentOnBell setting in rxvt-unicode sets urgency even when the window
--      has focus, and won't clear until it loses and regains focus. This is stupid.
-- In order to account for these quirks, we clear the urgency bit immediately upon
-- receiving notification (thus suppressing the repeated notifications) and track
-- the list of urgent windows ourselves, allowing us to clear urgency when a window
-- is visible, and not to set urgency if a window is visible.
-- If you have a better idea, please, let us know!
--
-- Update: I'm a doofus. Thanks to arossato's EventHook I see that the "9-10
-- times" thing was an Urgencyhook bug. If you fix it, and make UrgencyHook
-- ICCCM-compliant, you will win a prize.
