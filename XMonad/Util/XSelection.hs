{- $usage
    Add 'import XMonad.Util.XSelection' to the top of Config.hs
    Then make use of getSelection or promptSelection as needed; if
    one wanted to run Firefox with the selection as an argument (say,
    the selection is an URL you just highlighted), then one could add
    to the Config.hs a line like thus:

>  , ((modMask .|. shiftMask, xK_b     ), promptSelection "firefox")

    TODO:
             * Fix Unicode handling. Currently it's still better than calling
               'chr' to translate to ASCII, though.
               As near as I can tell, the mangling happens when the String is
               outputted somewhere, such as via promptSelection's passing through
               the shell, or GHCi printing to the terminal. utf-string has IO functions
               which can fix this, though I do not know have to use them here. It's
               a complex issue; see
               <http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2007-September/001967.html>
               and <http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2007-September/001966.html>.

             * Possibly add some more elaborate functionality: Emacs' registers are nice. -}

{- | A wrapper around getSelection. Makes it convenient to run a program with the current selection as an argument.
This is convenient for handling URLs, in particular. For example, in your Config.hs you could bind a key to
         @promptSelection \"firefox\"@;
this would allow you to highlight a URL string and then immediately open it up in Firefox.

promptSelection passes strings through the shell; if you do not wish your selected text to be interpreted/mangled
by the shell, use safePromptSelection which will bypass the shell using safeSpawn from Run.hs; see Run.hs for more
details on the advantages/disadvantages of this. -}

{- | Decode a UTF8 string packed into a list of Word8 values, directly to
